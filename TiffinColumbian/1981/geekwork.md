# Geek Work

Back to **[Obituaries](obituaries.md)**

First off, do not let the title of this page insinuate that this is a 
*male-oriented* task.  I know plenty of female `geeks`, if you will, and
they are certainly not geeks.  All it takes is a studious practice of
following syntaxical rules, which I believe, almost anyone can do.

While the system is a hosted on something called Github Pages, that may
or may not come into the picture.  The backbone of this system is a tech
capability called `Markdown`.  Markdown is a relatively easy-to-use shortcut
to writing `HTML`.  Here are some URL refereneces if look at 
the page source below and think you are up for the task:

 - [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
 - [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)

If you look at any of the pages on this obituary site, you will see a link
at the bottom of the page, *right justified*, that looks like this:

> This site is open source. Improve this page.

Click on the link.  This will enable you to see the source of any page.
It will show you the Markdown syntax used to create the page.  In many
cases, it is very simple.

*There are just rules to follow!*

If you want to help in this regard, please let me know.  If you want to help by
undertaking another class, let me know too.  I will make it happen and I
will work with you on problems that you might encounter.

*Creating something techy from scratch is **difficult**.  But modifying something
that already exists is **easier**.*
