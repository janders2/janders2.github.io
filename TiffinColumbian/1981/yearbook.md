# Yearbook Research

Back to **[Obituaries](obituaries.md)**

I opted not to include yearbook photos in this iteration of this service.
My reasoning is that photo-shopping is a very tedious process, and if I went that route,
I might never get anything done.  I never would have published these pages.

But if someone has the available time, or the time to carve out of their
busy schedule (that we all have), please volunteer to do this.

I am going to guess that it would be best if it were a **team effort**.  My
thoughts are that we would want the photos to be consistently prepared in
a standard size and format and resolution, etc.

I also saw a reference somewhere that a version of our yearbook is online.
It would be great if I could include a link to that as a starter.
