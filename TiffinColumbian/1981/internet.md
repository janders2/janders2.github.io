# Internet Research

Back to **[Obituaries](obituaries.md)**

At this point I do not offer any tips, per say.  There are huge wealth of information out there.
When searching for an obituary, you might find multiple hits.  Choose the one with the least amount
of advertising.  Choose the one that that is oriented towards the hosting funeral home.

And then there is a whole host of sites that offer ancestory research for a fee. I would suggest
that we use them only as a last resort, because whatever we want to share whatever we capture.
Anything gained from <Legacy.com>, <Ancestory.com> and others might be copyrighted too.

So far I have downloaded and saved the entire web page of each obituary that I have referenced.
They say things on the internet cannot disappear.  I do not necessarily believe that.  My backups
can be used if the official record goes wrong.
