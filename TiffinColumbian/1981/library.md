Back to **[Obituaries](obituaries.md)**

Before the year 2000, there were not many internet postings for obituaries.  Well
there wasn't much of any internet at all.  There was the newspaper, though, and at
least for us, the Advertiser Tribune is available on microfiche.

When I was in Tiffin for the 2021 Class Reunion, I spent the Friday morning at the
**Tiffin Public Library** researching microfiche of the **Advertiser Tribune**.  I
gathered some `jpgs` of newspaper articles and those are included in `news` links
on the obituaries page (slide or scroll to the right:  see Jim Roe, Charles Ward, 
etc).

But some of these jpgs did not come out to well.  They could be improved and other
research could be done to fill in the gaps of others that we have no record of.

I knew that this service was available, but was not exactly sure as to how to use
it.  I went in and *kindly* asked one of the attendants at the front desk
*How to the service* and she/he gave me an in-depth overview of the process.  I was
shown where the microfiche were located, how to reference an index of tapes available,
how to load the microfiche, and most importantly, how to zoom in and resolve an 
article and then make a photo that could be sent to my phone or email account.

So you can do this too.  It can be a rather enjoyable experience.  At least I found it 
was.  If you do help out, here are a few tips:

- Make a record of the microfiche that you recorded the information on.  Include 
  the date, section, column of the article.  This might help further improvements
  down the road, lest the resolution not be good and it needs to improve.  Because
  when you take that jpeg at the library, you will not know until later when you 
  view it on a laptop or computer, that the resolution
  really looks good.  (I failed to do this when I made my recordings).
  
- Keep focused, but enjoy at the same time.  You might be tempted to see how the 
  *Indians* were doing that day.  You will definitely find out that today's paper
  is an absolute ghost of what it once was.
  
- Be prepared to cry.  I got rather emotional when I was reading the articles 
  about past friends and classmates.  It was hard to do, to go from one terrible
  story to another.  Eventually, I got through.
