# Tiffin Columbian Reunions and Obituaries

This is a website for **Tiffin Columbian** classes that host future and past **Reunion** events,
and for which **Obituaries** of former classmates are posted in memorial.

- If you are interested in *refining* this process or creating a *duplicate* structure for your class,
please [contact me](./1981/contactme.md).  The material within is built using `MarkDown` on `GitHub` pages, so it is a relatively
simple process to construct, especially if you know what those terms mean.  ***It is also free.***

Currently, information for the following **Tiffin Columbian** classes have been gathered:

And conceivably this could be expanded to other high schools.
