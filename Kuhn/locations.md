These are all recent photos of important locations.  If you have time-dated photos, send them to me and
I will add them so that you can flip back and forth.

This is [Our Family Tree](https://www.gase.nl/Internettree/f5955.htm) as recorded by **The Family Tree of the American Gase** family.
It is not updated that much any more, but you can email Ronald Gase with corrections (see the bottom of each page); I have done it
before and eventually he will respond. *Mr. Gase lives in Germany and somehow has ties to Tiffin and sometimes visits*.
You can follow our ancestories back many generations on Mom and Dad's side.

This street is between the Hoover home and the Kuhn home.
If you follow it, you can go back to the "garden" and relive throwing potatoes
onto the railroad track.  Supposively there was a house trailer of some kind here many
years ago.  This is where...

The Kuhn house.

**328 Greenfield Street**<br>![](jpgz/328-greenfield.jpg)

experiences there.
